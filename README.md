This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is a React application built as both a platform for connecting Bike lovers with each other as well as an e-commerce store to purchase bikes and bike paraphenalia from participating merchants.

The application uses a Rails API backend using restful routes and standard conventions.

The app itself was built with React.js, Javascript, and Custom CSS.
